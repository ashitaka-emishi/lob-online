_One row is appended per PR cycle by `/tech-debt-report`. "Cumulative Added" is a gross historical total that only increases; it differs from the Executive Summary net score once items are resolved._

## Risk Assessment

No debt items recorded. Risk level: **None**.

PR #178 (tech debt closeout + team-review fixes) resolved all 5 previously open items. The calibration validation gap (#151, #175, #176) was addressed by extracting a shared `sanitizeCalibration` helper used across all write paths. The composable extraction items (#161, #169) were delivered, and the performance isolation issue (LOS/selection flags in `gridData`) was corrected so that hex selection no longer invalidates `useEdgeLineLayer`. The register is now clean.
