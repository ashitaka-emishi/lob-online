# issue-implement — State Machine

## 1. Description

The `issue-implement` workflow drives the full ticket-to-merge cycle for a GitHub issue.
It sequences issue-start, branch creation, implementation, doc-sync, ecosystem-docs-generate,
build, test, dev-start, editor review, dev-stop, PR creation, code review, merge, and issue
close, with six human gate checkpoints:

- **HCP 1** (gate-plan) — engineer approves the implementation plan before any code is written
- **HCP 2a** (gate-editor) — engineer reviews the running editor and approves or provides fix feedback
- **HCP 2** (gate-impl) — engineer approves doc-sync/build/test results before the branch is pushed
- **HCP 2b** (gate-review) — engineer decides how to handle PR review findings
- **HCP 3** (gate-merged) — engineer confirms the final squash merge
- **HCP 4** (gate-close) — engineer confirms closing the GitHub issue after merge

Loop-back choices at each gate return execution to the appropriate earlier step while
preserving accumulated `WorkflowInstance` state (step outputs, prior gate decisions).

On the **Fix** path at `gate-editor`, the engineer's note is stored as `$.gate-editor.note`
and injected into the next `implement` invocation via `inputMap.editorFeedback`. The skill
prompt instructs the AI to call `/dev-stop` before looping back so the server is never left
running on the fix path.

    [*] --> issue_start : start

    issue_start --> gate_plan : plan drafted (HCP 1)
    gate_plan --> branch : proceed
    gate_plan --> issue_start : revise

    branch --> implement : branch created
    implement --> doc_sync : code written
    doc_sync --> ecosystem_docs : project docs synced
    ecosystem_docs --> build : ecosystem docs regenerated
    build --> test : build passed
    test --> dev_start : tests ran
    dev_start --> gate_editor : server running (HCP 2a)
    gate_editor --> dev_stop : approve
    gate_editor --> implement : fix (after dev-stop in skill prompt)
    dev_stop --> gate_impl : server stopped (HCP 2)
    gate_impl --> pr_create : push
    gate_impl --> implement : fix

    pr_create --> pr_review : PR open
    pr_review --> gate_review : review complete (HCP 2b)
    gate_review --> pr_merge : accept
    gate_review --> implement : fix-all / fix-errors

    pr_merge --> gate_merged : checks pass (HCP 3)
    gate_merged --> gate_close : merge
    gate_merged --> [*] : hold

    gate_close --> close_issue : close (HCP 4)
    gate_close --> [*] : skip
    close_issue --> [*] : done
